# Description 

This addon adds a special lore system to indicate the origin of items from Minecraft and other addons. If an item belongs to Minecraft, the lore will display "Minecraft." If it comes from MyAddon, it will show "MyAddon." Additionally, it not only displays the source but also the creator of the item. For example:

**Minecraft → "Mojang"**

**MyAddon → "Dark"**

This system helps players track where items come from and who created them.
